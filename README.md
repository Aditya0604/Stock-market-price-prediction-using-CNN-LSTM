# Stock-market-price-prediction-using-CNN-LSTM
WIDS project
The motive of the project was to understand Algorithmic Trading strategies like momentum trading and pairs, and implement an LSTM-CNN model to predict the stock market prices from previous data. data used was provided by the mentors.

The week 1 started with basic understanding of python and its libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seabormn, scikitlearn, etc.
then we got to learn about data colection, preprocessing, data handling in the week 1 content itself.
Week 1 ended with some basic assignments , some of which were optional. These assignments focused on implementation of various libraries and applying what all we have learned. Also to xtract crucial informaton given some company data for three different months.

Week 2 followed with introduction to trading strategies and application in Finance. For this week's assignent we were suppose to implement the momentum and pairs trading strategy for the data given, initially it felt a bit tough and complex, but after the solutions were shared, it helped in the understanding, although still I wasnt able to completely understand the code and wish to continue exploring it hereon.

week3 was the introduction to the field of deep learning and implementing deep learning models using, keras, tensorflow or pytorch, etc. Although due to non availability of time, I wasnt able to do the week3 assignments as I was busy for the final week 4 project.

Week 4 was the final project to build a CNN- LSTM model to predict the stocks market prices, with help of provided paper, and some of the online articles, I was finally able to implement this model, which required standardizing the input data, creating a CNN-LSTM network, training the data using training data which was obtained after splitting the original data into training and test data.Finally obtaining the model'spredicted value to compare with the original value using basic evaluation metrics like MSE, RMSE, Rsquared score.
The model can be improved by experimenting with the parameter's value like epoch, batch size, activation function, number of filters, etc.
